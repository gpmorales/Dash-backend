          # "api-client-oidc" is a custom name for a specific OAuth 2.0 client registration within your application.
          # scope: openid: This line indicates that your application is requesting the "openid" scope.
          # In OpenID Connect, the "openid" scope is used for AUTHENTICATION and includes the ability to obtain identity information about the user.
